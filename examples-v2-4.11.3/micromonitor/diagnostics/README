This is an example of a non-RTEMS diagnostics program built using
MicroMonitor and the RTEMS tools.  It isn't setup to auto-adapt
to a new BSP.  You will have to edit the makefile.  

This program reads a key from the user to indicate what the results
of the "diagnostics" should (e.g. PASS, FAIL, or UNKNOWN).  The
MicroMonitor environment variable DIAGNOSTICS_RESULT is set to
that value.  This environment variable may be queried by MicroMonitor
scripts and the RTEMS application.

The file appboot in this directory is the MicroMonitor script that does this.
