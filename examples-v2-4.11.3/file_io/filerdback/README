#  README for simple example application
#

In this directory, you will find a simple RTEMS application and a Makefile.
It can be built by setting the environment variable "RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH"
and invoking make.

Here are a couple of example ways to do this using the erc32 BSP:

    RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH=/home/joel/gnat-3.10p/sparc-rtems/rtems/erc32 gmake 

The resulting application end up in o-erc32/test.exe.

An alterative way to do this is to set the environment variable separately:

  export RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH=/home/joel/gnat-3.10p/sparc-rtems/rtems/erc32
  gmake
