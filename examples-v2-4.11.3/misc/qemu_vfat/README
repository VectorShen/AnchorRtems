This directory contains an example program which should be of use
in some situations.  It is designed to be used with Qemu's
virtual FAT file system support.  Qemu can make a directory on
the host computer appear as a FAT file system to the simulated
system. This capability appears to have limits on the number
and size of files as well as some limitations about writes
from the simulated system appearing in the native file system.
But this should be useful for testing interpreters like Parrot,
Mono, or the RTEMS Shell.  

When testing an interpreter, you often want to have the same
executable exercised with different arguments or input files.
With this setup, you can copy those test support files into 
the host directory and the RTEMS "main" will use those in
support of the testing.
