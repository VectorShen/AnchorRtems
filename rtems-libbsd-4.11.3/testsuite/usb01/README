Attached are two source files of a simple USB demo.

https://www.rtems.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1601

The FreeBSD initialization is performed in mi_startup() (file
init_main.c).  Use the demo and single step through this with the
debugger.  A lot is done with linker sets, e.g. the driver initialization.

Look at c/src/lib/libbsp/arm/shared/startup/linkcmds.base and search for
"_bsd".
